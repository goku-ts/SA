**John 15:9 ISV "As the Father loves me, so do I love you. So abide in my love"**.

Sometimes, accepting what we feel we don't deserve, can make us feel unworthy and guilty.

God's love however, is beyond our understanding. I believe it is a mystery that cannot be explained. When we feel most undeserving of His love, that’s when He sees us as most deserving. **Romans 5:8 says, "But God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"**.

"As the Father loves me, so I also love you..." One of my most conscious confessions is "As long as the Father loves Jesus, Jesus loves me". Will the Father ever stop loving Jesus? No. So will Jesus ever stop loving me? No.

Jesus reassures His disciples that His love for them is not based on their actions, but on His Father’s love for Him. Their part was to learn to abide in His love.

His love is **unconditional**. However, abiding in His love depends on us. Verse 10 says, "If you keep my words, **you will abide in my love**, just as I have kept my Father’s words and abide in His love."

As we keep His words in our hearts daily, we will abide in His love daily.

**Let's Pray :**
Lord, thank you for loving me unconditionally. You look beyond my weaknesses and love me either way. I accept your love for me and I ask that you will help me stay in this love, by keeping your words daily. I ask for the grace to fellowship with Your Word and the Spirit. Thank you Lord for answering me, because of your love for me. Amen

**Acknowledge with me:**
I am deeply loved by the Father.
His love shines upon me.
His Words are an anchor to my soul
His love is my trademark !
