**_And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” John 1:46_**.

A mould can be a predefined shape or style used to shape objects according to its pattern and likeness.

We were created after the mould (image and likeness) of God from the beginning, yet after the fall, man came under a world and system, that had control over him, to reshape and remold him against God's original intent.

We can be, and have been shaped by so many moulds throughout our lives. From how we were raised, where we grew up, our friends, relationships, culture and tradition, our beliefs, traditional and social media, or even our own life experiences and especialy the things we hear.

We look like how we have been shaped. Not just our physical appearance, but our mindset, our speech, our attitude and response towards life, our fears and expectations.

From our scriptural text, we know Nazareth was known to be a place where nothing good comes from. It was a well known fact that anyone shaped after the mould of a Nazarene was everything else but something good.

Yet our Lord, who did and still does so much good, who was, who is and forever will be an embodiment of goodness, came from there!. 

Nazareth couldn’t mould our Lord because He will later become for us, our ultimate mould.

When we come into Christ, He becomes our perfect and ultimate mould!

_Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a **new creature**: old things are passed away; behold, **all things** are become **new**. - 2 Corinthians 5:17_

_But we all, with uncovered face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
2 Corinthians 3:18._

As we take our place in Christ, with faith in His love and finishes works, we break out of every wrong mould and take on the mould of the image and character of Christ.

    // Sometimes, accepting what we feel we don't deserve, can make us feel unworthy and guilty.

    // God's love however, is beyond our understanding. I believe it is a mystery that cannot be explained.

    // His love is **unconditional**. However, abiding in His love depends on us. Verse 10 says, "If you keep my words, **you will abide in my love**, just as I have kept my Father’s words and abide in His love."

    // As we keep His words in our hearts daily, we will abide in His love daily.

    // **Let's Pray :**
    // Lord, thank you for loving me unconditionally. You look beyond my weaknesses and love me either way. I accept your love for me and I ask that you will help me stay in this love, by keeping your words daily. I ask for the grace to fellowship with Your Word and the Spirit. Thank you Lord for answering me, because of your love for me. Amen

Father thank you for giving me Jesus as my ultimate mould, and breaking me out of all negative moulds, in Jesus' name.

I pray by revelation of who I am in Christ Jesus and I take my stand and authority in His name.


I hereby insist that I break out of any mould that has shaped me outside the image and character of Christ.

From wrong beliefs, to wrong words spoken over me, to every known and hidden pattern of negativity in my household and environment, I break out of them all in Jesus name.

I am in Christ, I am new!, I cannot and will not be shaped my the moulds of my past!

I ask that by the help of the Holy Spirit, I will be shaped after the mould of the image of Christ day by day.

Negative cultural and traditional moulds, you will no longer shape my life, be broken in Jesus name!

Negative and traumatic  past experiences, you will no longer shape my life, loose your power over me in Jesus name!

Wrong beliefs and mindsets,  you will no longer shape my life, loose your hold over me in Jesus name!

Ungodly and negative words spoken to me and over me, you will no longer shape my life, loose your hold over me in Jesus name!

I take on the mould of Christ, to shape my life, my health, my family, my future and all that relates to me in Jesus name.
