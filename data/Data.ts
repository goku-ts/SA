God's love however, is beyond our understanding. I believe it is a mystery that cannot be explained. When we feel most undeserving of His love, that’s when He sees us as most deserving. Romans 5:8 says, "But God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us".`

Lord, thank you for loving me unconditionally. You look beyond my weaknesses and love me either way.

Thank you Lord for answering me, because of your love for me. Amen `
