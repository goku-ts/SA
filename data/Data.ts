**_And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” John 1:46_**.

A mould can be a predefined shape or style used to shape objects according to its pattern and likeness.

We were created after the mould (image and likeness) of God from the beginning, yet after the fall, man came under a world and system, that had control over him, to reshape and remold him against God's original intent.

We can be, and have been shaped by so many moulds throughout our lives. From how we were raised, where we grew up, our friends, relationships, culture and tradition, our beliefs, traditional and social media, or even our own life experiences and especially the things we hear.

We look like how we have been shaped. Not just our physical appearance, but our mindset, our speech, our attitude and response towards life, our fears and expectations.

From our scriptural text, we know Nazareth was known to be a place where nothing good comes from. It was a well known fact that anyone shaped after the mould of a Nazarene was everything else but something good.

Yet our Lord, who did and still does so much good, who was, who is and forever will be an embodiment of goodness, came from there!. 

Nazareth couldn’t mould our Lord because He will later become for us, our ultimate mould.

When we come into Christ, He becomes our perfect and ultimate mould!

_Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a **new creature**: old things are passed away; behold, **all things** are become **new**. - 2 Corinthians 5:17_

_But we all, with uncovered face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
2 Corinthians 3:18._

As we take our place in Christ, with faith in His love and finishes works, we break out of every wrong mould and take on the mould of the image and character of Christ.
